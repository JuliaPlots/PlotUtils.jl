    adapted_grid(f, minmax::Tuple{Number, Number}; max_recursions = 7)

Computes a grid `x` on the interval [minmax[1], minmax[2]] so that
`plot(f, x)` gives a smooth "nice" plot.
The method used is to create an initial uniform grid (21 points) and refine intervals
where the second derivative is approximated to be large. When an interval
becomes "straight enough" it is no longer divided. Functions are never evaluated
exactly at the end points of the intervals.

The parameter `max_recusions` computes how many times each interval is allowed to
be refined.
